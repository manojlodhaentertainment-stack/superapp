# SuperApp AI — minimal demo

This repository contains a minimal, local demo of "SuperApp AI" combining an AI assistant (mock), video search (mock), shopping search (mock) and a few small tools.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes

- All AI, video and product endpoints are mocked for demo and privacy — replace with real APIs as needed.
- The project is intentionally small to be a starting point for mobile/web packaging.
